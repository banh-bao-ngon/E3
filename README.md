 🔍 Monitoring System Features

  1. DKA/HHS Protocol Monitoring

  - Blood Glucose Flagging: Automatically flags when BG > 250 mg/dL for 2+ consecutive hours
  - Infusion Rate Flagging: Alerts when calculated infusion rate < 2.0 units/hr for 4+ consecutive hours
  - Provider Notifications: Critical alerts prompt "Notify Provider" messages

  2. Non-DKA Protocol Monitoring

  - Stable Glucose Detection: Flags when BG remains stable (100-180 mg/dL) for 6+ consecutive hours
  - Transition Recommendation: Suggests "Consider switching to SQ insulin" when conditions are met

  3. One-Hour Assessment Timer

  - Countdown Display: Shows remaining time in MM:SS format
  - Target Time: Displays what time the hour will complete (Now + 1 hour)
  - Controls: Start, Stop, and Reset buttons with proper state management
  - Auto-completion: Notification when timer reaches zero

  4. Advanced Notification System

  - Real-time Pop-ups: Sliding notifications for critical and informational alerts
  - Severity Levels: Different styling for critical vs. informational flags
  - Auto-dismiss: Critical alerts stay for 30 seconds, info alerts for 10 seconds
  - Manual Dismiss: Users can close notifications manually

  5. Monitoring Panel UI

  - Fixed Position Button: Chart icon button with notification badge
  - Sliding Panel: Right-side panel with comprehensive monitoring dashboard
  - Timer Section: Visual countdown with large display and target time
  - Status Overview: Shows total readings, active flags, and timer status
  - Flag Management: View, acknowledge, and clear active alerts

  6. Data Persistence

  - localStorage Integration: All monitoring data persists across browser sessions
  - 24-Hour Data Retention: Automatically cleans old readings
  - State Recovery: Restores timers, flags, and monitoring data on page reload

  7. Integration with Existing Calculations

  - Automatic Data Collection: All insulin calculations now feed into monitoring system
  - Protocol Detection: Distinguishes between DKA/HHS and non-DKA protocols
  - Historical Analysis: Tracks patterns over time for condition detection

  8. Clinical Safety Features

  - Duplicate Prevention: Prevents repeated flags within 1-hour windows
  - Time-based Logic: Uses actual timestamps for accurate pattern detection
  - Critical Value Highlighting: Visual emphasis on urgent conditions
  - Provider Action Prompts: Clear instructions for clinical staff

  The system is now fully operational and provides real-time clinical decision support while maintaining the
  existing calculator functionality. Healthcare providers can now track patterns, receive automated alerts, and use
  the timer for regular assessments - all while ensuring patient safety through systematic monitoring.
